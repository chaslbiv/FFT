# FFT
Please help me, this is an FFT algorithm designed to parse data (that is not the issue).
When I try to convert the real and imaginary data to a spectral density, I get a "NAN" error (Not a Real Number)
Could somebody please troubleshoot this
It is written in Visual C++ using the terminal option, nothing too complicated.
Thank You
